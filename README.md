# Project Title

Stock Exchange simulator/video game
## Simulation systems
```-Companies exist and produce goods, which are bought by other companies or a single block "population".
-Good price is determined by companies, depending on how much goods were sold last turn
-Goods exist only in sale listings done by companies. 
-Money flows in a closed system, starting off in population. Currently amount of money a company can hold is hard-caped
-Separate "humans" exist, which buy shares in companies
```
## Plans for future
### Major
```
-Usable UI
-Price changes more organically, speeding up when further away from base price
-Make share buying/selling work like resoure listings
-Implement actual loan system
```
### Minor
```
-Finish converting IO system to JSON
-Make classes hold references to other components instead of string IDs
```
